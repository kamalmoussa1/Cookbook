# Cookbook*


I use this cookbook to learn new stuff, to practice, to solve or just to play around. 
Here I keep notes, codes, references that may or may not help oneday. 



*My Cookbook is inspired by [The Cookbook Method](http://www.devdungeon.com/cookbook) from the [DevDungeon](http://www.devdungeon.com) community.
